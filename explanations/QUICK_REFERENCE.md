# Ice and Rain Protection - Quick Reference Guide

## All 17 Questions with Correct Answers

### Wing Anti-Ice System

**13ICE10** - What are major components of the wing anti ice system?
- **Answer**: b, c, d (Anti-ice valves, Piccolo tubes, Anti-ice temperature sensors)
- **Key**: WAIVs control bleed air, piccolo tubes distribute heat, sensors monitor temperature

**13ICE06** - WING switch set to OFF in icing conditions?
- **Answer**: b (WAIVs closed, ICE caution + WING A/ICE OFF status display)
- **Key**: Misconfiguration warning - system won't override manual OFF selection

**13ICE16** - Wing anti-ice system distributes bleed to:
- **Answer**: a (Wing leading edge slats 2, 3, and 4 on each wing)
- **Key**: Not all slats are heated, only the critical mid-wing section

**13ICE13** - Wing Anti-Ice is inhibited:
- **Answer**: c (On the ground when speed is below 60 KIAS)
- **Key**: Prevents overheating and excessive bleed use during taxi

**13ICE11** - Piccolo tubes are perforated to allow bleed air to heat the slats
- **Answer**: a (True)
- **Key**: Perforations allow hot air to impinge on slat inner surface

### Cowl Anti-Ice System

**13ICE07** - Fan inlet cone and cover are de-iced using engine bleed air
- **Answer**: a (True)
- **Key**: 6th stage bleed air heats engine inlet components

**13ICE04** - When does ICE caution display for misconfiguration?
- **Answer**: b (When COWL switch is OFF and ice is detected)
- **Key**: Dangerous configuration - engine inlet unprotected in icing

**13ICE15** - COWL switch set to AUTO does what?
- **Answer**: b (Cowl heat controlled automatically by EECs)
- **Key**: EECs manage CAIVs based on ice detection, no crew action needed

**13ICE08** - Which system uses 6th stage engine bleed air?
- **Answer**: a (Cowl anti-ice system)
- **Key**: 6th stage = cowl (moderate temp), 10th stage = wing (higher temp)

### Ice Detection System

**13ICE09** - Two ice detectors are located where?
- **Answer**: b (On each side of forward fuselage)
- **Key**: Forward location = undisturbed airflow, representative conditions

**13ICE17** - Which system alerts pilots of icing conditions?
- **Answer**: b (Ice detection system)
- **Key**: Primary detection and alerting system via EICAS

**13ICE01** - Ice detection system alerts pilots of icing conditions
- **Answer**: a (True)
- **Key**: Core function is crew alerting through EICAS messages

**13ICE03** - Purpose of sensing probe in ice detection system?
- **Answer**: a (Detects ice by change in vibration frequency)
- **Key**: Magnetostrictive vibrating probe - ice changes resonant frequency

### Probe Heat System

**13ICE05** - Pressing PROBE HEAT switch on ground does what? (3 answers)
- **Answer**: b, c, d (ADS PROBE HEAT GND ON displays, GND ON illuminates, ADSPs and TAT heat on)
- **Key**: Windshield heat is SEPARATE system, not activated by PROBE HEAT

**13ICE02** - PROBE HEAT switch on ground heats which components? (2 answers)
- **Answer**: b, c (ADSPs and TAT probes)
- **Key**: Air data sensors - pitot, static, AOA, and temperature probes

### Windshield/Window Heat

**13ICE14** - How does windshield/window heat turn on?
- **Answer**: a (Automatically when AC power available and WIPC commands it)
- **Key**: NO manual control - fully automatic via WIPC

### Rain Protection

**13ICE12** - Maximum operating speed of windshield wipers?
- **Answer**: a (250 KIAS)
- **Key**: Structural and motor limits, above this speed rain blows off naturally

## Critical Systems Knowledge

### Bleed Air Sources
- **6th stage** → Cowl anti-ice (moderate temp/pressure)
- **10th stage** → Wing anti-ice (higher temp/pressure)

### Control Modes
- **AUTO** = Automatic based on ice detection (recommended)
- **ON** = Manual activation (always on)
- **OFF** = Disabled (warnings in icing)

### Key Speed Limits
- **60 KIAS** = Wing anti-ice activation threshold on ground
- **250 KIAS** = Maximum windshield wiper speed

### Protected Surfaces
- **Wing**: Slats 2, 3, 4 (each wing)
- **Engine**: Fan inlet cone and cover
- **Probes**: Pitot, static, AOA, TAT
- **Windshield**: Automatic electrical heating

### Warning Logic
- **ICE caution** = Anti-ice OFF + Ice detected = Misconfiguration
- **Status messages** = System state information (cyan)
- **Advisory messages** = Ice detected (amber)

## Study Tips

1. **Understand WHY, not just WHAT**
   - Know the engineering reasons behind each answer
   - Understand system integration and logic

2. **Key Distinctions**
   - Detection vs Protection systems
   - Automatic vs Manual operation
   - Bleed air stages and their uses
   - Ground vs Flight operation

3. **Common Traps**
   - Windshield heat ≠ Probe heat (separate systems)
   - Not all slats are anti-iced (only 2, 3, 4)
   - 6th stage ≠ 10th stage (different systems)
   - AUTO mode is EEC controlled, not manual

4. **Memory Aids**
   - "6 for Cowl, 10 for Wing" (bleed stages)
   - "60 to go" (60 KIAS wing anti-ice activation)
   - "Forward for First warning" (ice detectors forward fuselage)
   - "234 stay dry" (slats 2, 3, 4 are anti-iced)
