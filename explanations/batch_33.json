      "section": "Mass and Balance Procedures - Manual Loadsheet Preparation",
      "explanation": "According to OM-A paragraph 8.1.8.7, when preparing a manual loadsheet, the crew should NOT use a standard mass value of 20 kg for each piece of checked baggage. Instead, actual weights should be used or different standard values apply depending on the specific procedure being followed.",

      "source": "A220 operational documentation (search FCOM/OM-B for engine danger areas)",
      "section": "Engine Danger Areas and Ground Safety",
      "explanation": "The exhaust danger area extends from 61 meters (200 feet) at ground idle thrust to 183 meters (600 feet) at takeoff thrust. Personnel and equipment must remain clear of this area when engines are operating to avoid injury from high-velocity, high-temperature exhaust gases. The exhaust danger area is NOT negligible even at idle thrust.",

      "section": "Air Conditioning and Pressurization - Ground Operations",
      "explanation": "EMER DEPRESS does NOT need to be selected ON before leaving the flight deck when an external air conditioning source is connected with all doors closed. The aircraft pressurization system is designed to prevent inappropriate pressurization on the ground through automatic logic and safety interlocks. The EMER DEPRESS switch is used for emergency depressurization in flight, not for routine ground operations with external air conditioning.",
