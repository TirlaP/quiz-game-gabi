    "explanation": "Maximum Planned Takeoff Weight (PTOW) calculation for A220 considers: runway available (intersection B), damp runway conditions, temperature (6°C), pressure altitude (QNH 1020), and flap setting. For EVRA RW36 from intersection B with damp conditions and optimum flap setting, the performance calculation uses the A220 PERFO software TAKEOFF module. The limiting weight is determined by the most restrictive of: field length limit, climb limit (second segment and enroute), obstacle clearance, and brake energy limit. Damp runway reduces available takeoff distance by approximately 5-10% compared to dry conditions. With 65 tons expected TOW, the maximum PTOW would be calculated to ensure adequate margins for all limiting factors.",

    "explanation": "Optimum flap setting selection for A220 takeoff balances field length requirements with climb performance. Lower flap settings (Flap 1-2) provide better climb gradient but require longer takeoff distance. Higher flap settings (Flap 3-4) reduce takeoff distance but decrease climb capability. The A220 PERFO TAKEOFF module calculates the optimum setting considering: runway length available, obstacle clearance path, temperature, pressure altitude, and aircraft weight. For EVRA RW36 intersection B (damp) with 65 tons TOW at 6°C and QNH 1020, the performance software evaluates all flap options and recommends the setting that provides the best overall performance while meeting all regulatory requirements. Typically, Flap 2 or Flap 3 would be optimum for medium weights with adequate runway length.",

    "explanation": "Runway Condition Code (RCC) is part of the Global Reporting Format (GRF) used to standardize runway contamination reporting. The RCC scale ranges from 6 (dry) to 0 (very poor braking). When ATIS reports 'Damp' runway with 'Good' braking action, the correlation between descriptive braking action and RCC must be determined. However, ICAO guidance states that when only descriptive braking action is reported without contaminant type/depth, it is 'Impossible to identify' a specific RCC code. Damp conditions alone with Good braking would typically suggest RCC 5, but without proper GRF reporting format (contaminant type, depth, and coverage), pilots cannot definitively assign an RCC code. The crew should use DAMP performance corrections from the performance manual rather than attempting to assign an RCC code from incomplete information.",

    "explanation": "When ATIS reports '50% of runway covered with 1mm of dry snow' with braking action 'Medium-Good', RCC determination requires analyzing the contamination type, depth, and braking action report. Dry snow at 1mm depth is minimal contamination. The challenge is that 'Medium-Good' is not a standard ICAO braking action term - standard terms are Good, Good to Medium, Medium, Medium to Poor, Poor, and Less than Poor. This non-standard terminology makes it 'Impossible to identify' a specific RCC code. Even with 50% coverage, the crew cannot reliably assign an RCC without proper GRF format reporting. The reporting should include RCC codes for each third of the runway. Without standardized reporting, crews should request clarification or use the most conservative performance assumptions.",

    "explanation": "Similar to PERF04, when ATIS reports '50% of runway covered with 1mm of dry snow' with braking action 'Good', the RCC assessment faces challenges. While 'Good' is a standard braking action term (suggesting RCC 5), the reporting format is incomplete. Proper GRF reporting should provide RCC codes for each runway third, not descriptive terms. Dry snow at only 1mm depth with Good braking might suggest RCC 5 or even RCC 6 (if considering it nearly dry), but 50% coverage means portions are dry. Without proper runway thirds reporting and with mixed conditions, it remains difficult to assign a single RCC code. The answer depends on whether the operations manual allows correlation of 'dry snow 1mm with Good braking' to RCC 5, or whether incomplete reporting format makes code assignment impossible. Best practice is to request proper GRF format from ATC.",

    "explanation": "Operational Landing Distance (OLD) with multiple failures requires applying cumulative factors. The question presents: L ENG FAIL (Caution) with OLD factor 1.2, and HYD 1 HI TEMP (Caution) with OLD factor 1.3. When multiple unrelated failures affect landing performance, the A220 procedures specify whether to apply the highest single factor or multiply factors. For unfactored OLD of 1490 meters with multiplicative factors: 1490m × 1.2 × 1.3 = 2,324.4 meters, approximately 2,325 meters. This assumes factors are multiplicative rather than additive. The QRH Non-Normal Checklist for each failure specifies the required OLD factor, and when multiple independent failures affect landing, their factors are typically multiplied together to ensure adequate safety margin. The crew must verify the resulting factored distance does not exceed available runway length.",

    "explanation": "Following an inflight engine fire requiring L ENG FIRE procedure and engine shutdown, multiple OLD factors apply. The 'Shutdown - Left Engine' procedure requires OLD factor 1.2 for single-engine landing. Subsequently, ICE detection during descent triggers ice accumulation procedures requiring OLD factor 1.3. The question is whether these factors are multiplicative or whether the higher single factor applies. For A220 operations, when ICE is detected after engine shutdown, both conditions affect landing performance independently - reduced braking from one engine reverse (1.2 factor) and contaminated wing affecting lift/drag (1.3 factor). Multiplicative application: 1500m × 1.2 × 1.3 = 2,340 meters. Some operators use additive factors beyond 1.0: 1500m × (1 + 0.2 + 0.3) = 2,250 meters.

    "explanation": "Pre-takeoff landing performance verification requires calculating landing performance at the destination and alternate airports to ensure compliance with dispatch requirements. This is done using the LANDING-DISPATCH module of the A220 PERFO software, which applies regulatory safety factors. The dispatch factors are 1.67 for dry runway and 1.92 for wet runway (equivalent to dividing available LDA by these factors). This differs from in-flight landing calculations which use the LANDING-ENROUTE module with factors of 1.43 (dry) and 1.67 (wet). The higher dispatch factors provide additional safety margin for pre-flight planning. Before takeoff, crews verify that factored landing distance does not exceed LDA at destination and required alternate, considering forecast weather and expected landing weight. If landing performance becomes limiting, the aircraft must reduce takeoff weight or select a different alternate.",

    "explanation": "VREF speed corrections for wind gusts are calculated based on the gust increment (difference between steady wind and gust). For EVRA RW36 with ATIS reporting wind 080/6G14, the steady wind is 6 knots and gust is 14 knots, giving a gust increment of 8 knots (14-6=8). The A220 FCOM specifies that VREF should be increased by half the gust increment, rounded up. For an 8-knot gust increment: 8÷2 = 4 knots. This 4-knot correction is added to the base VREF for Flap 5 landing. The correction accounts for airspeed fluctuations during approach to prevent going below VREF in a downdraft. The value entered in the FMS PERF ARR page gust correction field would be 4 knots. Some operators may use the full gust increment (8 knots) or different methodologies, but standard procedure is half the gust increment with a typical maximum of 15 knots additive.",

The VREF+10 correction must be applied to the VREF speeds for the planned landing flap configuration. Typically this includes: the base VREF field for the selected flap setting, and potentially the speed bug/target speed. The question shows different colored arrows pointing to various fields - the correct fields would be those displaying the actual VREF values that will be used for approach speed calculation, not wind correction or other additive fields.

The ATIS shows wind 080/14 (14 knots steady wind from 080°, giving headwind component on RW36), temperature 6°C, QNH 1020. For A220-300 at approximately 44,000 kg with Flap 4, autobrake MED, the unfactored landing distance would be approximately 1,200-1,350 meters depending on wind component and airport elevation. EVRA (Riga) elevation is near sea level. With favorable headwind component and moderate weight, the OLD would be in the lower range. Using LANDING-ENROUTE factor of 1.43 for dry runway: base distance ~940m × 1.43 ≈ 1,345 meters.

    "explanation": "For A220 approach with autothrottle and autobrake engaged, the IAS selected in the FCP (Flight Control Panel) speed window after selecting Flap 5 should be VAPP (approach speed). VAPP = VREF + wind corrections. For YL-CSE at 50,000 kg landing weight with Flap 5, the base VREF is approximately 120 knots (varies by specific A220-300 variant). With ATIS wind 080/14 on RW36 approach, there is headwind component but also potential crosswind. If the wind is steady at 14 knots with no gusts reported, minimum wind additive may apply. The FCP speed window should display VAPP, which for this weight might be VREF (120 kts) + minimal wind correction = approximately 120-127 knots. The answer of 127 knots (option a) suggests VREF of approximately 120 kts + 7 kts correction, or base VREF of 127 if lighter.
