If a single GNSS failure occurs after the aircraft has passed the Initial Approach Fix (IAF), the LPV (Localizer Performance with Vertical guidance) approach can continue using the remaining GNSS receiver. The IAF represents the beginning of the approach segment where the aircraft is established on the approach procedure. This redundancy design allows for continued safe approach operations with one GNSS system remaining operational.

This is a defining characteristic that distinguishes LPV from other RNAV approaches which use geometric (altitude-based) vertical paths. The angular path means the glidepath angle remains constant relative to the ground, just like ILS. LPV approaches do NOT have lower minimums than ILS (they are typically comparable to Cat I ILS but not better), they absolutely cannot be used when GNSS receivers have failed (they require GNSS), and the RNP value for LPV approaches is typically 0.3 NM laterally during final approach, not 1.0.

(2) Select the HOLD menu item from the task menu that appears - this opens the holding pattern entry interface. (3) Type the required values (such as inbound course, turn direction, leg time/distance) in the appropriate data entry boxes to define the holding pattern parameters. Selecting CNCL is not part of the insertion process; it would cancel the operation. This graphical method is more intuitive than text-based entry and allows pilots to visually confirm the holding pattern location and orientation on the navigation display before execution.",

      "answerText": "ACTIVATE SEC, EXEC",
      "explanation": "The A220 FMS maintains both an active flight plan and a secondary flight plan for flexibility in flight planning. To replace the active flight plan with the secondary flight plan, two soft key selections are required in sequence: (1) ACTIVATE SEC - this prepares the secondary flight plan to become active and stages it as a pending change. (2) EXEC - this executes the change, making the secondary flight plan the new active flight plan. This two-step process prevents inadvertent flight plan swapping by requiring deliberate confirmation. The MOD option is for modifications, not activation. COPY TO SEC would copy the active to secondary (opposite direction), and while COPY TO SEC, ACTIVATE SEC seems logical, it's not the correct sequence - you don't need to copy before activating an existing secondary plan.",

      "answerText": "Five numbers without letters AND Three numbers preceded by 'F' or 'FL'",
      "explanation": "The FMS accepts two formats for entering flight levels in altitude data entry boxes: (1) Five numbers without letters (e.g., '31000' for FL310) - this represents the actual altitude in feet. (2) Three numbers preceded by 'F' or 'FL' (e.g., 'FL310' or 'F310') - this uses standard flight level notation. Both formats are recognized by the FMS and converted appropriately. The 'A' prefix is used for indicating altitude constraints (Above), not for entering flight levels. This dual-entry flexibility accommodates different pilot preferences and international conventions while preventing entry errors. For example, FL310 can be entered as either '31000' or 'FL310' and the FMS will interpret both as flight level 310 (31,000 feet pressure altitude).",

      "explanation": "The default Fuel On Board (FOB) mode in the FMS is CALC (Calculated). In this mode, the FMS calculates fuel quantity based on the initial fuel entry and subsequent fuel consumption calculations using engine fuel flow data. This is the default because it provides continuous fuel tracking from engine start throughout the flight. The other modes available are: SENSED (uses actual fuel quantity sensors, but this is not default due to potential sensor inaccuracies), and MAN (manual entry, used only in specific situations where calculated or sensed fuel is unreliable). The CALC mode default ensures the FMS always has a fuel quantity reference for flight planning and performance calculations even if fuel sensors have issues. Pilots can switch to SENSED mode when sensor data is reliable and desired.",

This allows pilots to experiment with routing changes or create a direct-to shortcut, visually review it on the display, and then cancel it if it's not suitable or no longer needed. EXEC would execute the modification (making it active), MOD would enter modification mode, and DONE is not a standard soft key in this context.

The message is displayed in white as an advisory/status indication (not a caution or warning) to inform the pilot that the system is operating on the backup GNSS receiver. This is consistent with the normal display philosophy where the left PFD shows information related to the captain's side systems. GNSS 2 failure would trigger a different message or display on the right side. Loss of SBAS (Satellite-Based Augmentation System) coverage would generate different messages related to approach capability, not GNSS REVERTED.

The ARM annunciation indicates that the system is ready and monitoring for the conditions to activate LPV guidance, but is not yet actively guiding the approach. This occurs when approaching the destination airport and provides advance notice that LPV capability is available and armed. The display changes from ARM to active LPV when the aircraft is established on the final approach course.

      "explanation": "Radius to Fix (RF) legs are specialized curved approach path segments that require precise database definition and cannot be manually created by the crew. RF legs are part of advanced RNP (Required Navigation Performance) procedures, particularly RNP AR (Authorization Required) approaches, and must be coded in the navigation database by procedure designers. The FMS can fly RF legs when they exist in the database-coded procedure, but pilots cannot manually construct these complex curved path segments. This limitation exists because RF legs require precise mathematical definitions including the radius, center point, and transition points that must be surveyed and published. Allowing manual construction could lead to flight path conflicts with terrain, obstacles, or airspace. Crews can only select and fly RF leg procedures that are already published and loaded in the navigation database.",

Amber indicates caution-level messages that require attention. This color coding follows standard aviation display conventions and allows pilots to quickly assess whether FMS messages require immediate attention (amber), simple review (white), or if there are no messages (gray/black).

      "explanation": "The UNABLE RNP message displays when the aircraft's Estimated Position Uncertainty (EPU) exceeds the Required Navigation Performance (RNP) value for the current phase of flight or procedure. EPU represents the FMS's real-time calculation of navigation accuracy based on available sensors, geometry, and signal quality. RNP represents the required navigation performance (accuracy) needed for the current operation. When EPU > RNP, the aircraft cannot meet the navigation accuracy requirements, triggering the UNABLE RNP message. This could occur due to GNSS signal degradation, loss of navigation sensors, or entering airspace requiring tighter RNP than achievable. Total System Error (TSE) is a different concept that includes EPU plus flight technical error. Flight Technical Error (FTE) and Path Definition Error are components of the navigation error budget but not the direct trigger for UNABLE RNP.

      "explanation": "When the SBAS (Satellite-Based Augmentation System) correction signal is lost during an LPV approach, the HSI displays an amber message 'LPV NOT AVAILABLE'. SBAS provides the differential corrections and integrity monitoring necessary for LPV approach operations. Loss of SBAS means the system can no longer provide the precision vertical guidance required for LPV minimums, so the approach must be discontinued or downgraded to a different approach type (like LNAV). The message is amber (not red) because it's a caution-level alert about reduced capability rather than a warning of immediate danger. The specific wording 'LPV NOT AVAILABLE' (not just 'NO LPV' or 'SBAS NOT AVAILABLE') clearly indicates what capability has been lost.

      "explanation": "True. The OFFSET data entry box is specifically designed to quickly create a parallel offset track from the active flight plan route. This function is commonly used for operational needs such as weather avoidance, traffic separation, or ATC requests to fly parallel to the filed route at a specified lateral distance (e.g., '5R' for 5 nautical miles right of track, or '10L' for 10 nautical miles left of track). The offset function maintains the same along-track waypoint sequence but shifts the entire lateral path by the specified amount. This is much faster than manually redefining the entire route with new waypoints. The offset can be easily removed by setting it back to zero. This feature is particularly useful in oceanic and remote area operations where ATC may request parallel offsets for traffic separation, or when circumnavigating weather systems while maintaining general routing structure.",

Default data includes items like fuel management settings, performance parameters, database preferences, and other baseline configurations that affect aircraft operation and performance calculations. Changing these defaults without proper authorization and technical knowledge could lead to incorrect performance calculations or unsafe operations. Preflight data, route identifier data, and airport identifier data are all operational entries that pilots routinely access and modify during normal flight operations, so these are not password protected.

(2) NADP (Noise Abatement Departure Procedure) - this profile is designed to reduce noise impact on communities near airports through modified thrust settings and acceleration/flap retraction schedules. NADP procedures typically involve either close-in noise abatement (NADP 1) or distant noise abatement (NADP 2). ACCEL is not a profile choice but rather refers to acceleration altitude settings within a profile. DISTANT is not a standard profile name (though NADP 2 is sometimes called distant noise abatement).

      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "answerText": "230/9000A11000B",
      "explanation": "The correct format for entering this constraint is '230/9000A11000B', which follows the FMS constraint syntax: Speed/AltitudeConstraint. The '230' is the speed in knots. The '/' separator divides speed from altitude. '9000A' means 'at or above 9,000 feet' (A = Above). '11000B' means 'at or below 11,000 feet' (B = Below). Combined, this creates a window constraint: cross at 230 knots between (at or above) 9,000 and (at or below) 11,000 feet. Option 'a' (230/9000/11000) doesn't specify the at-or-above/at-or-below nature. Option 'c' (230/F90A/F110B) incorrectly uses flight level format. Option 'd' (230/9000AB11000) has incorrect syntax with both letters together.

This is a safety feature that prevents inadvertent or unwanted route changes. If pilots realize the modification isn't what they intended, or circumstances change making the reroute unnecessary, pressing END discards all pending waypoint insertions and reverts to the flight plan as it was before modification began. It does NOT execute modifications (that's EXEC), close dialog boxes (that would be a CLOSE or X function), or insert waypoints at the end of the plan.

(2) Manual entry of all parameters - pilots can manually type in all waypoints, airways, procedures, and constraints using the MKP, providing complete flexibility when datalink is unavailable or for custom routing. (3) Accessing a stored route with a route identifier - commonly used routes can be stored in the FMS database with route identifiers (like 'ROUTE01') and recalled by entering the identifier, instantly loading the full route.

FTE represents how accurately the autopilot or pilot is flying the intended route - essentially, the cross-track error. This is distinct from: EPU (Estimated Position Uncertainty) which is the navigation system's uncertainty about where the aircraft actually is; Path Definition Error which is uncertainty in the computed path itself; and general 'Flight path error' which is too vague. The FTE is displayed as the RNP deviation scale on the HSI/PFD to show pilots how well they're tracking the intended flight path. In RNP operations, FTE must be kept within limits to ensure total system error (TSE = FTE + EPU + other errors) remains within the RNP value.

      "explanation": "When entering just the three digits '310' in an altitude data entry box (without any prefix like 'FL' or 'F'), the FMS interprets this as 310 feet, taking the entry literally. This is the default interpretation for pure numeric entries. To enter flight level 310 (31,000 feet), pilots must either: (1) Enter the full five digits '31000', or (2) Use the flight level prefix 'FL310' or 'F310'. This interpretation rule prevents ambiguity and follows a conservative approach - without clear indication of flight level intent, the system assumes the literal value. This could be important for low-altitude operations, missed approach altitudes, or minimum sector altitudes that might be a few hundred or thousand feet. The rule is: explicit altitude in feet unless prefixed with FL/F indicator. Understanding this convention prevents critical altitude entry errors. For example, a pilot intending FL310 who enters just '310' would get 310 feet, which could have severe safety implications if not caught.",

      "explanation": "This is a matching question that requires pilots to correctly associate FMS labels (such as tiles, fields, or interface elements) with their corresponding descriptions or functions. Without seeing the specific matching options, the general principle is that pilots must understand FMS nomenclature including: Tiles (major FMS pages like FPLN, PERF, DBASE), Tabs (subdivisions within tiles like DEP, ARR, FUEL), Fields and data entry boxes (specific input locations), Soft keys (context-sensitive function keys), and Hard keys (physical keyboard buttons). Correct matching demonstrates understanding of the FMS architecture and organization, which is essential for efficient operation under both normal and time-critical conditions. The FMS interface is highly structured with logical groupings of related functions, and understanding these relationships improves speed and accuracy of FMS operations.",

      "question": "FMS - PERF tile CRZ tab, what does CSC stands for?",
      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "answerText": "Constant Speed Cruise",
      "explanation": "CSC stands for Constant Speed Cruise, which is a cruise mode option available on the PERF (Performance) tile CRZ (Cruise) tab. In CSC mode, the FMS maintains a constant indicated airspeed or Mach number throughout the cruise, rather than adjusting speed for optimum economy or cost as altitude and weight change. This mode is useful when ATC requires specific speed maintenance, when flying in formation or trail, or when operational requirements dictate fixed cruise speed. The alternative cruise modes might include LRC (Long Range Cruise) or ECON (Economy) cruise where speed varies for optimization. CSC prioritizes ATC compliance and operational simplicity over fuel optimization. The other options - Continues Speed Calculation, Calculated Speed Correction, and Cruise Speed Constrain - are not standard FMS terminology and don't accurately describe a cruise mode selection. Understanding cruise mode options allows pilots to select the most appropriate mode for the operational situation.",

      "answerText": "PERF tile, DEP tab",
      "explanation": "V1, VR, and V2 takeoff speeds are entered in the PERF (Performance) tile on the DEP (Departure) tab. This location is logical because these speeds are performance-related parameters specific to the departure/takeoff phase. The PERF tile contains all performance data including takeoff, climb, cruise, and descent parameters. The DEP tab within PERF is specifically dedicated to takeoff performance data including V-speeds, assumed temperature (if used), takeoff weight, flap setting, and other departure performance parameters. The speeds would NOT be in: FPLN tile DEP tab (which contains flight plan routing for departure procedures, not performance speeds), PERF tile CLB tab (which contains climb performance, not takeoff speeds), or FPLN tile INIT tab (which contains initialization data like origin/destination airports, not speeds). The organization of performance data in the PERF tile and routing data in the FPLN tile keeps related information grouped logically.",

      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "answerText": "It is a solid amber mountain symbol",
      "explanation": "TAWS (Terrain Awareness and Warning System) caution alerts display on the VSD (Vertical Situation Display) as a solid amber mountain symbol. The amber color indicates a caution-level alert (as opposed to red which would indicate a warning level). The solid (not flashing) presentation is used for caution alerts, while warnings typically flash. The mountain symbol visually represents terrain, making the alert immediately recognizable. TAWS has two alert levels: Caution (amber, solid) provides advance notice of potential terrain conflict requiring awareness and possible action, while Warning (red, flashing) indicates immediate terrain threat requiring immediate action (pull up). The VSD is an ideal location for terrain alerts as it shows the vertical profile of the flight path relative to terrain. The solid amber mountain symbol appearing on the VSD alerts pilots to elevated terrain ahead that requires monitoring, allowing them to verify clearance and take preventive action before reaching warning level.",

(2) FPLN/PERF (Flight Plan/Performance) - contains default settings for flight planning and performance calculations including climb/cruise/descent profiles, cost index defaults, and other planning parameters. These defaults are airline-configurable parameters that affect how the FMS calculates and manages fuel and performance. They are separate from operational data entry. GNSS/FMS would be system configuration (not typically in basic defaults), and ROUTE/LEGS refers to operational flight plan data entry, not default configuration.

This is a critical design feature for thermal anti-icing.\n\n3. **Anti-ice temperature sensors (d)** - These sensors monitor the temperature of the bleed air and slat surfaces to ensure proper heating and prevent overheating. The IASCs use this temperature data to modulate valve operation and maintain optimal anti-ice performance.\n\nWhy 'a' is incorrect: Venturi tubes are not part of the wing anti-ice system. Venturi tubes are typically associated with pneumatic or air data systems, not thermal anti-ice applications. Reference: A220 FCOM Chapter 30-10 Wing Anti-Ice System"

      "explanation": "**250 KIAS (a)** is the correct maximum operating speed for the windshield wipers.\n\nThe windshield wiper system on the A220 is designed to operate safely up to 250 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS). This speed limitation is determined by:\n\n1. **Structural loading** - The wiper arms and blades are engineered to withstand aerodynamic forces up to this speed without damage or detachment\n2. **Motor capability** - The wiper motors can generate sufficient torque to move the blades against airflow pressure up to 250 KIAS\n3. **Operational envelope** - This speed covers most flight phases where rain removal is needed (approach, landing, takeoff, and climb)\n\nOperating the wipers above 250 KIAS could result in wiper blade damage, motor failure, or windshield scratching. At higher speeds, rain is typically blown off the windshield by airflow, making wiper operation unnecessary.\n\nThis limitation is published in the aircraft limitations section and should be observed by pilots during all operations.

These tubes are installed inside the leading edge slat cavities (slats 2, 3, and 4 on each wing).\n\n2. **Heat distribution mechanism**:\n   - Hot bleed air (approximately 200-250°C) flows from the engine through the Wing Anti-Ice Valves (WAIVs)\n   - This hot air enters the piccolo tubes\n   - The perforations (small holes) allow the hot air to escape from inside the tube\n   - The escaping hot air impinges directly on the inner surface of the slat structure\n   - Heat transfers through the slat material to the outer surface, preventing ice formation\n\n3. **Engineering advantages** of the perforated design:\n   - **Uniform heating** - Multiple perforations ensure even heat distribution along the entire slat length\n   - **Efficient heat transfer** - Direct impingement of hot air provides maximum thermal efficiency\n   - **Controllable flow** - Perforation size and spacing are engineered to optimize heating pattern\n   - **Lightweight** - Simple tube design minimizes weight penalty\n\n4. **Terminology origin** - Called 'piccolo' tubes because the small holes along their length resemble the finger holes on a piccolo flute\n\n5. **System operation** - When wing anti-ice is activated:\n   - WAIVs open\n   - Bleed air flows into piccolo tubes\n   - Hot air jets out through perforations\n   - Slat surfaces heat to above freezing temperature\n   - Ice cannot form on heated surfaces\n\nThis is a standard thermal anti-ice technology used on many aircraft wing leading edges.

It operates fully automatically, which:\n   - Reduces pilot workload\n   - Prevents windshield thermal stress from improper manual operation\n   - Ensures consistent, optimal heating cycles\n   - Eliminates possibility of pilot forgetting to activate the system\n\n2. **WIPC control logic** - The Windshield Ice Protection Controller (WIPC) automatically manages the system based on:\n   - **Temperature sensors** in the windshield glass\n   - **AC power availability** - System requires AC electrical power to operate\n   - **Windshield temperature limits** - Prevents overheating and thermal stress\n   - **Heating cycles** - Controls on/off cycling to maintain optimal temperature range\n   - **System health monitoring** - Monitors for faults or overtemperature conditions\n\n3. **Power requirements**:\n   - Requires AC electrical power from generators or external power\n   - Each windshield panel has independent heating elements\n   - High power consumption (several kilowatts per windshield)\n\n4. **Operational transparency** - The system operates in the background:\n   - Activates automatically when power is available and windshield temperature requires heating\n   - No pilot action needed for normal operation\n   - EICAS messages display only for malfunctions\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\n- **Option b (manual switches)** - Incorrect. There are NO manual windshield heat switches on the A220\n- **Option c (auto OR manual)** - Incorrect. Only automatic operation is available, no manual mode exists\n- **Option d (when either engine operating)** - Too simplistic. Requires AC power AND WIPC command based on temperature, not just engine operation\n\nThis automatic-only design is a modern approach that improves safety and reduces crew workload.

      "explanation": "**Cowl anti-ice system (a)** is correct.\n\nThe A220's anti-ice systems use different bleed air sources based on their temperature and pressure requirements:\n\n1. **Cowl anti-ice system - 6th stage bleed air**:\n   - **Bleed source** - Extracts air from the 6th stage of the engine compressor\n   - **Air characteristics** - 6th stage provides:\n     - Moderate temperature (hot enough for anti-ice but not excessive)\n     - Moderate pressure (sufficient flow without over-pressurizing the cowl cavity)\n     - Good availability across engine power range\n   - **Application** - This air heats:\n     - Engine fan inlet cone (spinner)\n     - Engine fan inlet cover (cowl inner surface)\n   - **Why 6th stage** - Optimal balance of temperature and pressure for engine inlet protection without excessive bleed air extraction that would reduce engine performance\n\n2. **Wing anti-ice system - 10th stage bleed air** (for comparison):\n   - Uses HIGHER stage bleed (10th stage)\n   - Requires hotter, higher pressure air\n   - Needs to heat larger surface area (multiple slats)\n   - Different pneumatic requirements than cowl system\n\n3. **Bleed stage selection engineering**:\n   - Earlier stages (lower numbers) = cooler, lower pressure\n   - Later stages (higher numbers) = hotter, higher pressure\n   - Each system uses the optimal stage for its requirements\n   - 6th stage is ideal for cowl anti-ice thermal requirements\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\n- **Ice detection system (b)** - Uses electrical power, not bleed air. Ice detectors are electrically heated\n- **Probe heat system (c)** - Uses electrical power from AC/DC buses, not pneumatic bleed air\n- **Wing anti-ice system (d)** - Uses 10th stage bleed air, not 6th stage (hotter air needed for larger heating area)\n\nUnderstanding bleed air sources is important for system operation and troubleshooting.

Temperature sensors in the anti-ice system monitor bleed air, not the ice detection probe\n- **Option c (monitors ice on ADSP probes)** - Incorrect. The ice detector is separate from air data probes and doesn't monitor them\n- **Option d (monitors engine case temperatures)** - Incorrect. Engine temperature monitoring is a separate system unrelated to ice detection\n\nThe vibration frequency method is the standard technology for modern ice detection systems.

The ability to quickly identify message types by color and format is critical for proper prioritization of crew actions during abnormal situations. Messages are displayed in priority order (Warning/Caution/Advisory/Status) with newest messages of each type appearing first.",

In CAGED MODE, the FPV's lateral drift component is removed, showing only the vertical flight path angle. This mode is useful for determining angle of attack more precisely by eliminating the drift indication. In normal (conformal) mode, the FPV shows both vertical and lateral flight path, moving anywhere on the display to indicate the actual direction of aircraft movement. In NON-CONFORMAL mode, the FPV may be displayed with reduced accuracy when certain data is invalid. The caged mode helps pilots focus on pitch performance without the distraction of lateral drift, particularly useful during approaches or when assessing angle of attack margins.",

      "explanation": "The A220 has four Air Data Smart Probes (ADSPs), each providing redundant air data measurements. Each ADSP measures: Static pressure (for altitude and vertical speed calculations), Pitot/dynamic pressure (for airspeed calculations), and Angle of attack (for stall protection and flight envelope protection). The four ADSPs provide quadruple redundancy for critical air data, with the system able to cross-check between probes to detect failures or discrepancies. Additionally, the aircraft has two separate AOA vanes and two Total Air Temperature (TAT) probes for further redundancy. This matching question tests understanding of which ADSP feeds which system (e.g., Captain's instruments vs First Officer's instruments, autopilot systems, Integrated Standby Instrument). The redundancy architecture ensures that failure of any single ADSP does not compromise flight safety or the availability of critical air data.",

      "explanation": "The statement is TRUE. In fly-by-wire normal mode, the aileron trim switch is inhibited and has no function because the FBW system automatically maintains coordinated flight and manages any asymmetric conditions (such as fuel imbalance or engine failure) through its control laws. The system continuously adjusts control surface positions to maintain wings-level flight without requiring manual trim inputs from the crew. Aileron trim only becomes functional in direct mode, where the advanced FBW protections and automatic coordination are lost and manual trim may be needed to reduce control forces.",

Plug-type doors feature a wedge-like design that seals themselves when interior pressure differs from exterior pressure - the cabin pressure differential forces the door against its frame, creating a secure seal. These doors move inward first before rotating out, and cannot open with pressure differential present. The aft equipment bay door is not a plug-type door. This design configuration protects critical pressurized areas while allowing the aft bay door to use a simpler, lighter design for non-pressurized compartment access."

      "explanation": "The A220 passenger and service doors feature an automatic disarming mechanism when opened from the OUTSIDE, even with the Mode Select Handle in the ARM position. When the external handle is operated to open an armed door, the system automatically disengages (designates) the girt bar, which disconnects the slide pack from the door, thereby PREVENTING inadvertent slide deployment. This safety feature protects against costly and dangerous slide deployments during ground operations when doors are opened by ground crew or when passengers/crew open doors from outside after landing. The girt bar disconnection happens automatically - no manual intervention is required. However, opening the same door from INSIDE while armed WILL cause slide deployment, as this indicates an emergency evacuation scenario."

      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "correctAnswerText": "red",
      "explanation": "The cargo door mechanical visual indicator displays RED when the door is NOT LOCKED (unlocked/unsafe condition). This color-coded system provides immediate visual status: RED = UNLOCKED/UNSAFE and GREEN = LOCKED/SAFE. When ground crew or pilots perform walk-around inspections, seeing red on any cargo door indicator immediately signals that the door requires attention and must be properly secured before flight. The red indication appears when the door locking handle is not fully engaged or when locking mechanisms have not properly seated. Only when the door is completely closed and all locks are engaged will the indicator show green."

      "explanation": "The Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) control panel is located on the overhead panel in the flight deck on the A220. This allows the flight crew to test the ELT before flight and to manually activate it if needed. The control panel typically includes an ARM/ON/OFF switch and a TEST/RESET button. The overhead location provides easy accessibility for the pilots during pre-flight checks and in emergency situations. While the ELT unit itself may be located elsewhere (such as in the electrical equipment bay), testing is performed from the flight deck control panel for practical accessibility.",

Halon is particularly valuable in aviation because it is a clean agent that leaves no residue, does not conduct electricity (safe for electrical fires), and is effective in the confined spaces of an aircraft. Halon works by chemically interrupting the combustion chain reaction. The A220 has portable halon extinguishers positioned in strategic locations: behind the copilot seat (accessible to flight crew) and in the forward and aft galleys (accessible to cabin crew).

L ENG or R ENG FIRE switch/light illuminated on the Engine and APU Fire Panel; e. L or R FIRE light illuminated on ENGINE panel; f. L ENG or R ENG FIRE warning message on EICAS",
      "note": "The question asks for FOUR responses. Based on FCOM, the four main indications are: Fire switch/light (d), FIRE indicator on ENGINE panel (e), FIRE warning message on EICAS (f), and aural warning + master WARNING (c). Option 'a. Engine BTL LO advisory' is incorrect as this appears AFTER bottle discharge, not during initial fire detection. Option 'b. FIRE advisory message' is incorrect because it's a WARNING message, not advisory."

        "Flight vs Ground Protection Logic: Many APU faults (high oil temp, low oil pressure, fire) only cause automatic shutdown on GROUND, not in flight. This protects backup power availability during flight. Only critical ECU faults and failed starts cause shutdown in both regimes.",
        "Cooldown Period: 60-second cooldown when APU switch positioned to OFF, especially after bleed air use, protects APU from thermal stress.",
        "Dual Battery Requirement: Both batteries needed for battery-only start - Battery 1 powers ECU, Battery 2 powers starter motor.",
        "ECU Control: ECU certified for unattended ground operation, controlling all aspects from door position to shutdown.",
        "AC Power Only: APU provides AC power (3-phase, 400 Hz, 115 VAC), not DC. TRUs convert APU AC to DC for aircraft systems."

      "explanation": "During takeoff and landing phases, certain EICAS messages are inhibited to reduce pilot workload during these critical, high-task-load phases of flight. The message types that are inhibited are: (a) Caution messages (amber) and (d) Advisory messages (cyan). Warning messages (red) are NEVER inhibited as they indicate conditions requiring immediate action. Status messages (white) are also inhibited. The inhibit begins during takeoff from start of takeoff roll until reaching 400 feet AGL, and during landing from approximately 800 feet AGL until touchdown or go-around. Once the inhibit phase ends, all suppressed messages are displayed.",

      "explanation": "When the fly-by-wire (FBW) system operates in normal mode, it provides comprehensive flight envelope protection through various pitch, roll, and yaw protections and limits. These include bank angle protection (limiting maximum bank), load factor protection (limiting g-forces), stall protection (alpha floor and nose-down command), overspeed protection, and turn coordination. Normal mode is active when at least one PFCC is functioning normally and all required sensors are available. The system does not just provide structural protection or basic control - it actively manages the flight envelope to prevent pilots from exceeding safe operating limits while maintaining intuitive handling characteristics.",

      "explanation": "This statement is TRUE. Pressing the ADS pushbutton on the reversion switch panel cycles through the air data sources of the associated PFD. This allows the pilot to manually select which Air Data Smart Probe (ADSP) is providing data to their Primary Flight Display. The normal configuration has each PFD receiving data from its primary ADSP, but in case of an air data source failure or discrepancy, the pilot can manually cycle through alternate air data sources. This is part of the redundancy and reversion capability built into the A220's air data system, which has four ADSPs providing multiple backup sources.",

      "explanation": "The overspeed protection function on the A220 has several key characteristics: (1) It automatically reduces thrust and/or applies pitch control inputs to prevent the aircraft from exceeding Vmo/Mmo, (2) It operates through the Primary Flight Computer (PFC) and is part of the Normal Law protections, (3) The system provides both aural warnings (overspeed clacker) and visual warnings (red and black striped barber pole on the airspeed indicator), (4) In the event of an overspeed, the system commands nose-up pitch to reduce airspeed, and (5) The function remains active in Normal Law but may be degraded in Alternate or Direct Law.",

      "explanation": "The slave FMS on the A220 has three primary functions: (1) Monitor the master FMS - it continuously monitors the calculations and outputs of the master FMS to detect any discrepancies or errors, (2) Synchronize flight plan data - it maintains an identical copy of the active flight plan and automatically updates when changes are made on the master FMS, (3) Provide automatic backup/reversion - if the master FMS fails, the slave FMS automatically becomes the master and continues navigation without interruption. This redundancy ensures continuous navigation capability.",

      "explanation": "On the A220, fuel is normally distributed to the engines by the collector tanks and associated fuel pumps. Each wing has a collector tank that receives fuel from the main tanks via transfer pumps. The collector tank boost pumps then supply fuel directly to each engine. This architecture ensures a constant fuel supply to the engines even during maneuvers. The fuel distribution system includes AC motor pumps for primary fuel feed and a DC backup pump for each engine.",

      "explanation": "EMER DEPRESS must be selected ON before leaving the aircraft unattended with cargo or passengers aboard for an extended period. This selection ensures that in the event of an emergency requiring rapid cabin depressurization (such as smoke or fire), the emergency depressurization can occur automatically. The EMER DEPRESS function allows for controlled cabin altitude increase to match ambient conditions, facilitating emergency evacuation. This is a safety requirement in the aircraft servicing procedures.",
